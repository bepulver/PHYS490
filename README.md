# PHYS324 - Anneal Offsets project

The goal of this project is to determine the effects that anneal offsets have on a fully connected clustering algorithm on the DWave Adcantage computer
This builds heavily off of the clustering algorithm made in the PHYS390 Repository. Here's the link: https://github.com/bepulver/PHYS390
